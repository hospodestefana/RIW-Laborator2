The scope of the IEEE 802 project includes Wired/Wireless LAN (Local Area Networks, like Ethernet and Wi-Fi), Wireless PAN (Personal Area Networks), Wireless MAN (Metropolitan Area Network), Wireless Coexistence, Media Independent Handover Services, and Wireless RAN (Regional Access Network). Emerging IEEE 802.1 on IEEE 802 Privacy and Addressing efforts encompass multiple medium access technologies: Privacy (IEEE P802E)Â The IEEE P802E project works on recommended practices for protocol developers to mitigate privacy threats, identified by a specified privacy threat model. MAC Addressing (IEEE P802c and P802.1CQ)Â IEEE 802 MAC addressing will be covered including the Global and Local address spaces, as well as work underway on Local MAC address usage and on distribution of Local MAC addresses and Multicast MAC addresses.
