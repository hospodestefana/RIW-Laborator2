Newcomers' tutorials are presented the Sunday before every IETF meeting and, when possible, in the local language where the meeting is taking place. Scott Bradner, who revised and presented this tutorial at the IETF for many years, produced a series of bite-sized IETF introductory videos specifically designed for online viewing for his Harvard University Extension School class. The Harvard Extension School graciously agreed to close caption the videos and let the IETF make them available for general viewing. The playlist of these Newcomers Training videos can be found here on the IETF YouTube channel.
