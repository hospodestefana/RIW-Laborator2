XML. Recently, it has become more popular in a wide range of communities to write text in the plaintext-like "markdown" format. New tools help do this, and also perform a number of chores in the process that used to be manual work). This tutorial looks at what's available and then focus on the "kramdown" set of tools, which enhances markdown with a bit of structured YAML for the management of references. It also reviews popular workflows that minimize manual work while optimizing collaboration with co-editors and contributors.
