The tutorial covers the essential NROFF commands and demo the tool. For xml2rfc, the tutorial includes a brief introduction to XML for novices and will cover the usage of the 'processing instructions' that are available to control the appearance of the final document. Using xml2rfc relieves draft authors of the need to think about getting the boilerplate and overall format right, and provides citation libraries that reduce the pain of generating references to I-Ds, RFCs, and other document series.
