In this section Hide in this section Groups Internet Engineering Steering Group Internet Architecture Board Internet Research Task Force IETF Administration and Operations Committee IETF Trust Nominations Committee Tools Team Directorates Key Info The NomCom is comprised of at least one chair, 10 voting volunteers, 2-3 liaisons, and an advisor. The NomCom Chair is appointed between the first and second meetings of the year, and the new NomCom officially begins its work once the selected volunteers are seated following the volunteer solicitation, random selection and community review time periods. Details of the selection and operation of the Nomcom can be found in IAB, IESG, and IAOC Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees (RFC 7437 / BCP 10) and Publicly Verifiable Nominations Committee (NomCom) Random Selection (RFC 3797) The NomCom Chair Is appointed by the Internet Society President Ensures that NomCom completes its duties on schedule and in the best interest of the community Does not vote on the selection of the candidates Serves as an advisor to the next NomCom The IESG and the IAB each provide a liaison to serve on NomCom, and ISOC Board of Trustees may also choose to provide a liaison. The ten voting members of the NomCom are selected through a complex, random process detailed in RFC 3797. In order to serve on the NomCom, an individual must have attended at least 3 out of the last 5 IETF meetings. Once the NomCom has recommended candidates for the open positions, the candidates are reviewed and confirmed by another body. The IAB is responsible for confirming IESG candidates, the ISOC Board of Trustees confirms candidates for the IAB and the IESG confirms the candidate for the IAOC position.
