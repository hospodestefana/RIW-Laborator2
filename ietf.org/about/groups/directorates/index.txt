These comprise experienced members of the IETF and the technical community represented by the area. The specific name and the details of the role for each group differ from area to area, but the primary intent is that these groups assist the Area Director(s), e.g., with the review of specifications produced in the area." Some directorates cover a whole IETF Area, such as the Security Directorate which covers the IETF Security Area (SEC). Some directorates are focused on a specific technology or industry activity, such as the Internet of Things Directorate. A complete list of directorates is available on the IETF Datatracker.
