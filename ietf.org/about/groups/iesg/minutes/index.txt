In this section Hide in this section Internet Engineering Steering Group IESG Members IESG Meeting Minutes Appeals Key Info IESG meetings are currently generally conducted via teleconference technologies. IESG meeting minutes are provided beginning in 1991. In some cases, narrative minutes are also provided. Narrative minutes are intended to give more detail about discussions during IESG teleconferences, but they do not replace the official minutes as the record of decisions. Narrative minutes are considered informal and are not a complete record of the discussions. 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 1994 1993 1992 1991 RFC Editor IANA IAB IAOC IRTF IETF Trust Secretariat: AMS ISOC Privacy policy Website feedback
